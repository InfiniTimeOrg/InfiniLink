Please report any issues that you find, crashes you experience, or suggested changes to me! Your feedback allows you and me to work together to have a great companion app. Reports are welcome through TestFlight, or through GitHub, Matrix, or Mastodon (links are available in the settings tab).")

				Text("- The music controls do work in InfiniTime, but only if you're playing music through the Apple Music app. System-wide music control in iOS requires the proprietary Apple Media Service to be implemented in InfiniTime. At the app level, I can really only interact with Apple Music, and have no control over podcasts, YouTube videos, system volume, etc. until AMS is added to InfiniTime.")

There is currently an issue with Bluetooth advertising in Infinitime that the developers are working extremely hard on. Wish them luck!")
